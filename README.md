Julia GLPK module
=================

GLPK.jl is a wrapper for the [GNU Linear Programming Kit library](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk).
It makes it possible to access nearly all of GLPK functionality from within Julia programs.

The documentation can be found at https://gplkjl.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.1/glpk.html, or
in the doc/ directory (see doc/README.md).
